ideas:
- The pipeline implements an adaption and automation of a commonly used method called Corrected-Total-Cell-Fluorescence (CTCF), which determines the level of cellular fluorescence from fluorescence microscopy images. 
-  Simply put, CTCF normalizes the integrated density of your regions of interest (ROIs) by subtracting the background fluorescence in your image.
