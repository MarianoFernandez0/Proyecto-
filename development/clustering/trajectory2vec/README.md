# trajectory2vec

simulation in "Trajectory clustering via deep representation learning"

## Required Packages:

Tensorflow = 0.11.0rc0, 
pandas = 0.19.0, 
sklearn = 0.17.1
traj_dist =  https://github.com/maikol-solis/trajectory_distance


## Useage:
### simulate_data.py: 
Generating the synthetic trajectories 'sim_trajectories' in /simulated_data/.
Here, we only generate 30 trajectories as the sample.
### tmb2vec.py: 
Embed each trajectory to a fixed-length vector utiziling our framework. 
Five files is generated in /simulated_data/
* sim_trajectories_complete : Trajectories after attributes completion.
* sim_trajectories_feas : Elementary features computed by each pair of continuous records
* sim_behavior_sequences : Behavior sequence generated sliding windows and Feature Extraction Layer
* sim_normal_behavior_sequences : Moving behavior sequence after normalizaion
* sim_traj_vec_normal_reverse : Vector of trajectories generated by Seq2Seq Auto-Encoder Layer

### compared_methods.py:
Four distance based trajectory clustering methods(DTW, EDR, LCSS, Hausdorff) were compared with our framwork.
After compution, distance matrixs are generated in /distances/.
