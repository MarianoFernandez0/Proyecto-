    """
    This is an abstract base class for objects used as sub-states in
    State.ModularFilter.

    SubState is an abstract base class that specifies the methods which are required for an object to function as a sub-state of State.ModularFilter.

    Some of these methods are implemented and most likely do not need to be
    reimplemented in a derived class implementation (for example the #dimension
    and #covariance methods.

    Other methods may have a rudimentary implementation that may be suitable for
    some derived classes, but not others, depending on the specific
    functionality of the derived class (for instance #getStateVector and
    #storeStateVector).

    Finally, some methods are specifically tagged as abstract methods and are
    not implemented at all.  These methods must be implemented in the derived
    class.  This is usually because there is no way to implement even a
    rudimentary version of what the method is supposed to do without having some
    knowledge of what kind of substate the derived class contains (for instance
    :meth:`timeUpdate` and :meth:`getMeasurementMatrices`).

    In any case, the documentation for each method of SubState contains a
    generalized description of what functionality the implementation should
    provide in a derived class.
